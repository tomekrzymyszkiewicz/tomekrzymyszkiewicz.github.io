By trial and error and experimenting with different techniques, I managed to develop my own method of note-taking while reading books.</p> <h1 id="the-assumptions">The assumptions</h1> <p>In developing the method, I was driven by the following assumptions:</p> <ul> <li>The method is to help remember content for a long time after it has been read.</li> <li>The method is to enable efficient recall of content long after reading. (When I have already managed to forget).</li> <li>The method must not interfere with the reading process so strongly that it causes distraction.</li> </ul> <h1 id="method">Method</h1> <h2 id="reading-environment">Reading environment</h2> <p>If I can, I read books on my Kindle (with the internet on it to sync where I left off). This allows me to read on my phone when I don’t have the reader with me, exactly from where I left off on the reader.</p> <p>If a book contains a lot of diagrams or pictures, then I buy it in hard copy, which makes it easier to work on the content.</p> <h2 id="reading">Reading</h2> <p>When reading a book, I focus purely on immersion - I turn off the indicator of how many percent I have already read and the hour in the Kindle.</p> <p>If a fragment of the book <strong>clearly stands out (resonates)</strong> I highlight it. If I don’t know a word, I highlight it and look it up in the dictionary. Sometimes it may be a lack of knowledge of the meaning of a word in the native language, and sometimes it may be a lack of knowledge of the translation in a foreign language book.</p> <h3 id="book-development">Book development</h3> <ul> <li>I import the highlights from the Kindle into <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> on my computer using the <a href="https://github.com/hadynz/obsidian-kindle-plugin">Obsidian Kindle Plugin</a>.</li> <li>I create a book note (separate, different from the note with imported highlights) where I mark in the metadata information about the book (name, author, etc.) as well as information when I read it. Adds links to existing (or not) notes on topics covered in the book.</li> <li>I add references to highlights from a note containing highlights from the book. I add my thoughts to the highlights.</li> </ul> <p><strong>The process of processing highlights and reading are two separate events</strong> separated clearly in time. Waiting an appropriate amount of time before starting to process allows me to gain a broader horizon and naturally process the content I have read. Only after a certain period of time do I return to the content of the book. Familiarizing myself with the highlights helps me recall parts of the book and my thoughts that I have acquired in between.</p> <p>The processed book note serves as a reference for developing the issues covered in the book, which are the topics (“topic notes”) written out at the beginning of the note.</p> <h3 id="learning-vocabulary">Learning vocabulary</h3> <ul> <li>I open Vocabulary Builder in Kindle.</li> <li>Deletes accidentally added words.</li> <li>Based on the words I don’t know, I create a flashcard. I save the word to the list of flashcards and mark it as “Mastered” in Kindle.</li> <li>I use the created fiches to learn vocabulary using a box with dividers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system">Leitner system</a>).</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="notetaking"/><category term="reading"/><category term="notetaking"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[my workflow to efficient reading by making notes]]></summary></entry></feed>
