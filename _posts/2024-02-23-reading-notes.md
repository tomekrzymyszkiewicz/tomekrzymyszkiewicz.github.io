# The genesis of developing a quotation system

About six months ago I found myself wanting to reference a story from the book [Van Troff's Cylinder by Janusz Zajdel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Troff's_Cylinder) (a great dystopia that puts the reader in the place of the novel's action), but I couldn't remember it precisely, even though I read it 3 years ago. By trial and error and experimenting with different techniques, I managed to develop my own method of note-taking while reading books.

# The assumptions

In developing the method, I was driven by the following assumptions:
- The method is to help remember content for a long time after it has been read.
- The method is to enable efficient recall of content long after reading. (When I have already managed to forget).
- The method must not interfere with the reading process so strongly that it causes distraction.

# Method

## Reading environment

If I can, I read books on my Kindle (with the internet on it to sync where I left off). This allows me to read on my phone when I don't have the reader with me, exactly from where I left off on the reader.

If a book contains a lot of diagrams or pictures, then I buy it in hard copy, which makes it easier to work on the content.

## Reading

When reading a book, I focus purely on immersion - I turn off the indicator of how many percent I have already read and the hour in the Kindle. 

If a fragment of the book **clearly stands out (resonates)** I highlight it. If I don't know a word, I highlight it and look it up in the dictionary. Sometimes it may be a lack of knowledge of the meaning of a word in the native language, and sometimes it may be a lack of knowledge of the translation in a foreign language book.

### Book development

- I import the highlights from the Kindle into [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) on my computer using the [Obsidian Kindle Plugin](https://github.com/hadynz/obsidian-kindle-plugin).
- I create a book note (separate, different from the note with imported highlights) where I mark in the metadata information about the book (name, author, etc.) as well as information when I read it. Adds links to existing (or not) notes on topics covered in the book.
- I add references to highlights from a note containing highlights from the book. I add my thoughts to the highlights.

**The process of processing highlights and reading are two separate events** separated clearly in time. Waiting an appropriate amount of time before starting to process allows me to gain a broader horizon and naturally process the content I have read. Only after a certain period of time do I return to the content of the book. Familiarizing myself with the highlights helps me recall parts of the book and my thoughts that I have acquired in between. 

The processed book note serves as a reference for developing the issues covered in the book, which are the topics ("topic notes") written out at the beginning of the note.

### Learning vocabulary

- I open Vocabulary Builder in Kindle.
- Deletes accidentally added words.
- Based on the words I don't know, I create a flashcard. I save the word to the list of flashcards and mark it as "Mastered" in Kindle.
- I use the created fiches to learn vocabulary using a box with dividers ([Leitner system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system)).
